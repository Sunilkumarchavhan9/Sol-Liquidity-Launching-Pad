# Project Overview

Sol Token Launch Pad is a platform designed to simplify the creation, management, and launch of Solana-based tokens. The project consists of two main parts:

## Backend
Handles the core logic, API endpoints, and business rules for:
- Creating new tokens on Solana
- Minting tokens
- Managing liquidity pools (add, create, swap)
- Providing modular React components for each feature
- Ensuring secure and efficient interactions with the Solana blockchain

## Landing Page
Acts as the public-facing interface for users and visitors:
- Showcases the platform’s features and benefits
- Provides onboarding and educational content
- Displays social proof and trust signals
- Guides users to start creating or managing tokens
- Currently under development, with new sections and components being added

## Folder Structure
- `backend/`: Contains all backend logic, API routes, and core components
- `landingpage/`: Contains the landing page UI, marketing sections, and user onboarding flows

## Technologies Used
- Next.js (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Solana Web3 libraries

## Goals
- Make token creation and management accessible to everyone
- Provide a secure, user-friendly launch pad for Solana projects
- Support community growth and trust through transparent features
